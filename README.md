# ISED-2016
This contains the code for IOT challenge held in IIT Patna in December 2016
We built smart containers which are capable of tracking the home suplies like pulses , rice , sugar , salt 
using Load Sensor's.
We take the data in via a an arduino and then serially send it to a raspberry pi which then hosts a local site where it gives you
the details about quantites of different substances and their preditive lasting time

Write now Code is of
1. Arduino Connected to Load Sensor using Hx711
2. Rpi connected to Rpi hosting the sever and taking the data form arduino
(python script yet to be uploaded)
